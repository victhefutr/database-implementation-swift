This project is a simple key-value store database implemented in Swift

<h4>This project is a simple key-value store database implemented in Swift. Through this project, I aim to gain a deep understanding of database construction, from the fundamentals of B-trees and persistent storage to indexing and efficient data management. The entire system is built in Swift, and it includes an API that allows other software to easily connect and interact with the database.</h4>
